# goChess

-This is a project I am undertaking in order to learn the Go programming language.
-My current goal is to have a fully functional chess engine, most likely contained in the command line.
-The engine will hopefully be an improvement on my previous chess engines in terms of speed, as I am implementing 
the move generation logic using bitboards instead of multidimensional arrays.
